        <p>Tony Bennett may have left his heart in San Francisco, but we left ours in Paris.	Cafe Claude is a modern day evocation of vintage Paris in the heart of San Francisco. Unpretentious and utterly charming, Cafe Claude encompasses the feeling of old-world intimate French bistros with the hospitality sensibilities of Northern California.</p>
	<br>
	<p>French-driven culinary expressions, sumptuous wine lists and expertly crafted bar programs converge with rich textures and classic interior elements to create a transportative experience steeped in tradition and brimming with European style. Unique and distinct in character, Caf√© Claude exudes a playful sense of escapism and a convivial atmosphere with approachable French fare and a warm service staff.</p>

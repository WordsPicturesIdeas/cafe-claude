        	Cafe Claude Downtown<br>
Café Claude, with its furnishings rescued from a retired Parisian café, feels like Paris. The curving zinc bar, vintage tables, and period travel posters evoke a wonderful sense of déjà vu as you enter to the sounds of animated conversations.
Reminiscent of the narrow streets and alleyways of Paris, tiny Claude lane is located between Union Square and the financial district. A longtime popular restaurant and bar, Café Claude has remained an unpretentious neighborhood meeting place nestled amongst the urban skyscraper. Whether you are shopping, looking for a quick bistro lunch, or seeking a discreet rendezvous, Café Claude is an ideal destination. Enjoy the lively atmosphere, weekend jazz, and hearty inexpensive food seated in a cozy banquette or outdoors under heated patio seating. Sample such luncheon favorites as onion soup gratinée, croque monsieur, or salade Niçoise. In the evening, dig into a portion of pan seared ahi tuna with onion confit, or classic coq au vin in red wine port sauce. Daily specials are always worth trying and the house made desserts are not to be missed. So slowdown, sip a refreshing pastis or quaff a robust cote du Rhone and escape the stress of the day in a relaxed way.

Cafe Claude Marina<br>

Vintage French Glamour<br>
Designed to feel as if the restaurant has been nestled in its location for decades, the intimate surroundings of the 50-seat restaurant—designed by Elmer Lin of Consortium and owner Franck LeClerc—evoke old world French glamour and gentlemen’s club-chic. Drenched in vibrant nostalgic flair, the restaurant’s coquettish space proudly boast antiqued tin ceilings, burgundy flocked wallpaper, dark wood wainscoting and shimmering vintage chandeliers sourced from France. The restaurant also includes outdoor café seating and a six-person private "Chef's Table", a crescent shaped leather banquette enveloped in damask wallpaper and cloaked from the rest of the restaurant in rich fabrics.
